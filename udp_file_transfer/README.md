# UDP File Transfer

This application aims to transfer a file from a client to a server using
a UDP connection.

All values for IP addresses, ports and file names are hardcoded in the
`client_ftp.py` and `server_ftp.py` files.

It is suggested that the `server_ftp.py` is run first, since it awaits for a
client to start sending data.
