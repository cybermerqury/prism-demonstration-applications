# Hello World Text Transfer

This application aims to periodically send a text message from a client to a
server using either a UDP or TCP connection.

All values for IP addresses and ports, as well as the actual message itself are
hardcoded in the `client.py` and `server.py` files.

It is suggested that the `server.py` is run first, since it awaits for a
client to start sending data.
